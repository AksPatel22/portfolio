    brief: [
      "Call Break is a captivating trick-taking card game that combines strategic planning with sharp decision-making. Played by four players with a standard deck of 52 cards, the game revolves around predicting and bidding on the number of tricks each player aims to win in a round. Each hand presents an exciting challenge as players strategically play their cards to capture valuable tricks while avoiding the hazardous Queen of Spades, which carries penalty points.",
      "The game unfolds in rounds, with players taking turns as the dealer. The objective is to fulfill or surpass the bid made at the beginning of the round while avoiding overtricks that can lead to negative scoring. The player with the highest cumulative score at the end of a set number of rounds emerges as the victor.",
      "Call Break offers a blend of skill, tactics, and psychological warfare as players attempt to read their opponent's intentions and adapt their strategies accordingly. Its diverse gameplay and ever-changing dynamics make it a favourite among card game enthusiasts, providing endless hours of entertainment and a platform for cultivating strategic prowess.",
